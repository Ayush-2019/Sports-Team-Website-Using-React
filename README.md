# Sports-Team-Website-Using-React

This amazing website can be considered as complete in all scenerio:-

This is the Sports Website that is developed using ReactJS as the primary technology.

The UI of the website is made beautiful using various libraries like :-

1. react-awesome-reveal
2. react-move
3. d3-ease
4. Toastify
5. Material UI

These libraries has helped me to make the UI such appealing that user will willingly stick to it, bacause of Animate, Fade, Zoom, Slide, Toasts and various such effects.

The website uses various React Hooks like :- useState, useEffect, useReducer that adds functionality to the project.

The project uses firebase database. The website displays details of Matches and Players, fetched directly from Firebase. User can add new data and edit the existing data, which also includes adding and changing of existing image, which is made possible because of react-firebase-file-uploader library.

An authentication system is also built using firebase that allows manipulation of data only if the user is Signed In.

The website is succesfully deployed using Firebase:-
